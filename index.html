        <h1>Freddy Wootton(website not in use)</h1>
        <p> Welcome to my website. I am a second-year maths student at the University of Exeter. </p>
        <p>
            Last year, I was elected to be the Vice President of the University's Maths society (MathSoc).
            In this position,
            These responsiablities have developed my leadership skills.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I am currently training to be an academic representative.
            In this role, I will analyse views and opinions from students on topics ranging from supervision, teaching and assessment,
            to course administration, learning resources and personal career development.
            I plan to work with staff to ensure that feedback is addressed, creating solutions and making positive change for students. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoy coding. To demonstrate this, below is a simple application showing how altering the standard deviation affects the normal distribution.
            This was coded in r and deployed using the shiny package.
            Notice how as you increase the standard deviation, the data tends to deviate more.
            This is because the definition of standard deviation is the average difference a data point is away from the mean.
            The seed value determines how the data is randomly generated. This demonstration was coded in R and deployed using the Shiny package.
        </p>
